### Who Am I {#who-am-i}

I thrive in places where I don't know everything and I get to figure out how things work together. Whether it's technology or cross-cultural travel, I seek out opportunities to learn. I'm looking for an opportunity with new things to figure out.

### Experience {#experience}

LendingClub Corporation
: *Security DevOps Engineer*
  __August 2014 to Present__
  Starting out As part of the 4 person on-call rotation, I troubleshoot issues and get my hands dirty on every layer of LendingClub's infrastructure, from setting up high level synthetic monitoring all the way down to dropping the raw hardware onto racks.

  Technology for this 200+ microservice infrastructure includes:
  -  monitoring with Splunk, New Relic, Catchpoint, SignalFX, and Nagios
  -  Cisco UCS compute with Nimble, Pure, & EMC VMAX/ExtremeIO storage
  -  virtualization and provisioning through VMWare and Cloudstack
  -  configuration management with Puppet and Salt
  -  automation and source code management with Jenkins and GitHub


e-ITguy.com
: *Linux Administrator*
  __February 2010 to August 2014__
  After graduating college, I worked at a non-profit. To cover my student loan debts, I started freelancing for businesses needing linux help remotely.

  My clients included Web Weaver Elite, a 1500+ dedicated turnkey Wordpress hosting provider, ChinaSoft, a web development firm split between Denmark and China, and SoftNAS, provider of network attached storage (NAS) virtual machines.


CTI Music Ministries
: *May 2009 to January 2014*
  __2004-2005__
  As the only technical support for a non-profit organization of 20-30 full-time staff and volunteers, I inherited a woefully out of date technical system. I addressed the pain points in the organization while reducing overall cost.

  The most significant cost savings included migration to a self-hosted Asterisk VoIP telephony server, migrating multiple databases to a unified Salesforce instance and architecting logistical plans to flight pack a full sound system to minimize airline checked bag fees.
