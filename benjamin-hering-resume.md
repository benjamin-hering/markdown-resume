### Who Am I {#who-am-i}

I thrive in places where I don't know everything and I get to figure out how things work together. Whether it's technology or cross-cultural travel, I seek out opportunities to learn. I'm always looking for opportunities with new things to figure out.

### Experience {#experience}

LendingClub Corporation
: *Senior Security DevOps Engineer*
  __August 2014 to Present__
  Starting out as part of the 4 person on-call rotation, I got my hands dirty on every layer of LendingClub's infrastructure, from high level synthetic monitoring all the way down to dropping the raw hardware onto racks. After gaining operations experience, I pioneered the creation of a new team to focus exclusively on paying down security technical debt in LendingClub's infrastructure while continuing to be a key player in responding to both major security incidents and operational issues.

  Projects include:
  - Fully deprecating of old and unmaintained Imperva WAF to F5 ASM for all public facing properties, enabling a new guarantee  of 100% WAF protection of all public properties, and automatic signature updates. 
  - Security education and advocacy through internal teaching. Topics include pentest results and remediation, multifactor authentication benefits, and active threats to the LendingClub platform.
  - Automation and scripting of regularly exercised security controls

  Technology for this 200+ microservice hybrid datacenter and AWS infrastructure includes:
  -  monitoring with Splunk, New Relic, Catchpoint, SignalFX, and Nagios
  -  Cisco UCS compute with Nimble, Pure, & EMC VMAX/ExtremeIO storage
  -  virtualization and provisioning through VMWare, Cloudstack & AWS
  -  configuration management with Puppet and Salt
  -  automation and source code management with Jenkins and GitHub


e-ITguy.com
: *Linux Administrator*
  __February 2010 to August 2014__
  After graduating college, I worked at a non-profit. To cover my student loan debts, I started freelancing for businesses needing linux help remotely.

  My clients included Web Weaver Elite, a 1500+ dedicated turnkey Wordpress hosting provider, ChinaSoft, a web development firm split between Denmark and China, and SoftNAS, provider of network attached storage (NAS) virtual machines.


CTI Music Ministries
: *IT and Logistics Manager*
  __May 2009 to January 2014__
  As the only technical support for a non-profit organization of 20-30 full-time staff and volunteers, I inherited a woefully out of date technical system. I addressed the pain points in the organization while reducing overall cost.

  The most significant cost savings included migration to a self-hosted Asterisk VoIP telephony server, migrating multiple databases to a unified Salesforce instance and architecting logistical plans to flight pack a full sound system to minimize airline checked bag fees.
